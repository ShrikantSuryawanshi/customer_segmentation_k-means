# Customer Segmentation using k-means machine learning algorithm
This is a machine learning project in which cluster analysis has performed on the dataset of mall customers. The method used in this project is k-means algorithm. 
The clustering is done according to their Annual income and spending score in the mall.
The k-means method uses arithmentic mean of the distance between a particular datapoint and the pre-fixed centroid.
First, the data-preprocessing is done in which the statistical measures are calculated.
Also checked missing values and did some plotting under exploratory data analysis. 
Elbow method is used to find the appropriate number of clusters to be used in this model.
The model is developed and clusters are made that can we interpreted easily using a visualization.
